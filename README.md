At the time of making this, the only Voron 2.4 CAD model available was for the 250mm default size. I reconfigured the model for the 350mm side. This isn't the default configuration and instead has the modifications and color scheme that I was planning to use. If you wish, you can take the original design provided by the Voron design team and swap out the changes that I made. Just thought it might help someone else in the future since I saw that a few people in the discord had asked about a 350mm CAD in the past.

I'm trying to get a .Step file attached but currenly it's really large. I see that the .iam file doesn't open in Solidworks. Here is a link to the .Step file, maybe someone can help me out or figure out how to correctly export the model: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U8n2_3oXsNYw9b1Ct-PLaM6QVImMud1D/view?usp=sharing

At the time of making this, the only Voron 2.4 CAD model available was for the 250mm default size. I reconfigured the model for the 350mm side. This isn't the default configuration and instead has the modifications and color scheme that I was planning to use. If you wish, you can take the original design provided by the Voron design team and swap out the changes that I made. Just thought it might help someone else in the future since I saw that a few people in the discord had asked about a 350mm CAD in the past.
